# Random Password Generator

This Python script generates secure random passwords that adhere to modern security rules. The generated passwords include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository or download the `password_generator.py` file.

3. Run the script from the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python password_generator.py
```

4. The script will prompt you to enter the desired length of the password. After entering the length, it will generate a secure random password and display it.

## Customization

You can customize the password length by providing the desired length when prompted by the script.

Feel free to modify the character sets used in the script based on your specific security requirements.

Enter the length of the password: 16
